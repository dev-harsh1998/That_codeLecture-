#Function Pointers
Function pointers are the defination that are used to point to some function in the code.

## Benifits
`Passing a function pointer as a paratmeter in the function that actually calls a function within a function depends upon a refrence the pointer was assigned to.`

`A single function pointer could refer to a set of functions and call them accordingly`

`There are many more benifits to it but i am lazy to write them here`

## Good habits
`Always typedef your function pointer defination so it doesn't scare away the code reviewer or reader`
